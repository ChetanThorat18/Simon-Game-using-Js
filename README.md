**#How to Play Simon Game**
Welcome to the Simon Game! Test your memory and pattern recognition skills by following the sequence of colors. Your goal is to reach the highest level possible. Here's how to play:

Start the Game: Press any key to start the game. The initial level is displayed on the screen.
Gameplay: The game will generate a sequence of flashing colors and sounds. Each color corresponds to a button: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow. You'll need to replicate this sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

Level Up: Successfully repeat the sequence, and the game will add a new color to the sequence. The level counter will increase, indicating your progress.

Repeat the Sequence: Pay close attention to the sequence of colors. Once the sequence is completed, it's your turn to click the buttons in the exact same order.

Highest Score: The game will track your highest score as you play. The highest score represents the highest level you've reached. Try to beat your highest score with each playthrough.

Game Over: If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or click the buttons in the wrong order, the game will end. Your final score will be displayed, along with your highest score. You can then press any key to start a new game and beat your previous record.

Remember, the game becomes more challenging as the sequence gets longer with each level. Test your memory and have fun
